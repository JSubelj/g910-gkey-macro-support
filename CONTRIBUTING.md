First read the [wiki](https://github.com/JSubelj/g910-gkey-macro-support/wiki)! This can also been seen on [here](https://github.com/JSubelj/g910-gkey-macro-support/wiki/Contributing)

There are many ways you can contribute to this project. But first of all I would like to thank you for using my software, trying to enhance it and giving me the energy to improve it.

# Adding your code
If you like to improve the driver first check if anyone is already working on that. If not post an Issue and/or assign yourself to it so we can know that you are working on it. If you can also post a deadline when you will probably finish. Then just fork the project (if you fork my code just to have it on your GitHub page you should be ashamed), do your magic and then issue a pull request. I will review your code and if I have any questions I will ask them in the pull request. If you don't answer in a few days I will probably decline the pull request.

If you have any questions on the issue you are currently working on, send me an email or post it in the Issue you are working on and I will be glad to help.

If you think you can greatly enhance the project contact me on my email (at the bottom of this page), we will talk and if I see you are interested and qualified I will add you to the team.

If you don't already have a favourite ide you can try [pycharm community](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/download/) it is free and has a lot of good features to help you write better code. It's also available via snap: `sudo snap install pycharm-community`

# Requesting additional features
If you have a bright new feature that you want to see in my driver and don't know how to code it in please write an Issue and if it looks good I will gladly implement it.

# Correcting my grammar mistakes
Because I am not a native speaker my english is not really good (as you probably saw). So if you like to correct the grammar mistakes please post an issue or email me and we will work this out.

# Saying thanks
If you just want to thank me for the driver send me an email and I will gladly reply to you. You are the one that keeps me going in developing this driver.

# Logitech employees
If you work for Logitech and want to use my code for an official Logitech driver for GNU/Linux (and I have to say you should be ashamed to not release it ten years ago) email me and we will work something out.

# Donating
If you would like to donate to this project please contact me on my email. If there is interest I will also set up a PayPal account or something. (I will be eternally grateful to you).
